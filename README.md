# vite-plugin-vue-sfc-styles-inject

This plugin will rewrite the code generated by `@vitejs/plugin-vue` so the styles of SFCs are injected into the DOM when their render function is first executed.
This way the styles of the component are automatically added when the component is used, and not included in the final build when it is not (tree shakable).

:no_entry: **[DEPRECATED]** Please use the rewrite at [https://github.com/Stnaire/vite-plugin-vue-styles-inject](https://github.com/Stnaire/vite-plugin-vue-styles-inject). It works the same.
